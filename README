Statistics::OLS 
  - perform ordinary least squares and other bivariate statistics, v 0.03.

I wrote Statistics::OLS to perform Ordinary Least Squares (linear curve
fitting) on two dimensional data: y = a + bx. The other simple
statistical module I found on CPAN (Statistics::Descriptive) is
designed for univariate analysis. It accomodates OLS, but somewhat
inflexibly and without rich bivariate statistics. Nevertheless, it
might make sense to fold OLS into that module or a supermodule someday.

Statistics::OLS computes the estimated slope and intercept of the
regression line, their T-statistics, R squared, standard error of the
regression and the Durbin-Watson statistic. It can also return the
residuals.

It is pretty simple to do two dimensional least squares, but much
harder to do multiple regression, so Statistics::OLS is unlikely ever
to work with multiple independent variables. 

This is an early draft, and has not been extensively tested. It has
worked on a few published datasets. Feedback is welcome, particularly
if you notice an error or try it with known results that are not
reproduced correctly.

Installation:

Untar and unzip the distribution and cd into its directory. Then the
usual

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

should work. Since this is alpha code, you might prefer to install it
in a private library. In that case, replace the first command with

  perl Makefile.pl PREFIX=/home/sally/myperl

or whatever.
